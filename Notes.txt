-- NOTES --

CPU
- 8 u8 registers - abcdefhl
- Some instructions write to two registers at once to create "virtual 16 bit registers"
these are af, bc, de, hl
- f register is special flag register lower 4 bits are always 0's cpu writes to upper 4 bits
    Bit 7: "zero"
    Bit 6: "subtraction"
    Bit 5: "half carry"
    Bit 4: "carry"  
    Can hold flag register as class instead for easier handling
- Use enums for instructions
- Implement instructions
-16bit program counter

Use the program counter to read the instruction byte from memory.
Translate the byte to one of the instances of the Instruction enum
If we can successfully translate the instruction call our execute method else panic which now returns the next program counter
Set this next program counter on our CPU

MEMORY

-0x0000 -> 0x00FF hard codeded memory for boot/load
-memory starting at index 0x100 until index 0x3FFF include the contents of the cartridge.
