  Info: Direct Memory Access controller for Game Boy sprite data transfers
  Description: The dma module implements the Game Boy's DMA controller for high-speed transfer
              of sprite attribute data from main memory to OAM (Object Attribute Memory).
              Provides cycle-accurate transfer timing and proper access restrictions.

  DMA Struct Members:
    active: Transfer Status - Indicates if DMA transfer is currently in progress
    current_byte: Transfer Progress - Current byte offset being transferred (0-159)
    byte_value: Source Page - High byte of source address (source = byte_value * 0x100)
    start_delay: Startup Delay - Initial delay cycles before transfer begins (2 cycles)

  DMA Transfer Process:
    1. Game writes source page to DMA register (FF46)
    2. DMA controller starts with 2-cycle startup delay
    3. Transfers 160 bytes (0xA0) from source to OAM
    4. Each byte transfer takes 1 cycle
    5. Total transfer time: 162 cycles (2 startup + 160 transfer)

  Core Functions:
    DMA::new: Constructor - Creates DMA controller with default inactive state
    dma_start: Transfer Initiator - Begins DMA transfer with specified source page
    dma_tick: Transfer Engine - Processes one cycle of DMA transfer operation
    dma_transferring: Status Query - Returns true if DMA transfer is currently active

  Memory Layout:
    Source Address: (byte_value * 0x100) + current_byte
    - Supported ranges: 0x0000-0xDFFF (ROM, VRAM, WRAM)
    - Forbidden ranges: 0xE000-0xFFFF (Echo RAM, OAM, I/O, HRAM)
    
    Destination: OAM (0xFE00-0xFE9F)
    - 160 bytes total (40 sprites Ã— 4 bytes each)
    - Direct write to PPU's Object Attribute Memory

  Access Restrictions:
    During DMA Transfer:
    - CPU cannot access OAM (reads return 0xFF)
    - CPU can still access other memory regions
    - DMA has priority over CPU for OAM access
    - Game execution continues during transfer

  Timing Accuracy:
    - 2-cycle startup delay before first byte transfer
    - 1 cycle per byte transferred (160 cycles for full transfer)
    - Total transfer time: 162 cycles
    - Transfer occurs at CPU speed (1MHz)

  Hardware Integration:
    - Triggered by write to DMA register (FF46)
    - Integrates with bus for source memory reading
    - Coordinates with PPU for OAM writing
    - Provides status for CPU access control

  Performance Features:
    - High-speed batch transfer (faster than CPU copy loops)
    - Non-blocking transfer (CPU continues execution)
    - Efficient sprite data loading for games
    - Minimal overhead transfer management

  Sprite Data Format:
    Each sprite consists of 4 bytes in OAM:
    - Byte 0: Y position (screen coordinate + 16)
    - Byte 1: X position (screen coordinate + 8) 
    - Byte 2: Tile number (sprite pattern index)
    - Byte 3: Attributes (palette, flip, priority flags)
