    Info: Hardware emulation module declarations for Game Boy components
    Description: The hdw module contains all hardware emulation components that collectively implement
                a complete Game Boy system. Each sub-module represents a specific hardware component
                with accurate timing and behavior emulation.

    Hardware Components:
      cpu: Central Processing Unit - Sharp LR35902 processor with custom instruction set
      bus: Memory Management Unit - Handles memory mapping and I/O routing between components
      cart: Cartridge Interface - MBC1, MBC2, MBC3 memory bank controllers with battery save support
      ram: Random Access Memory - Work RAM and High RAM (WRAM/HRAM) management
      ppu: Picture Processing Unit - Graphics rendering with sprites, backgrounds, and window layers
      apu: Audio Processing Unit - 4-channel sound synthesis (pulse, wave, noise)
      lcd: LCD Controller - Display timing, modes, and register management
      gamepad: Input Controller - Joypad input handling and button state management
      timer: System Timer - Programmable timer with interrupt generation
      dma: Direct Memory Access - High-speed memory transfer controller
      interrupts: Interrupt Controller - Hardware interrupt management and priority handling
      emu: Emulation Engine - Core timing, context management, and system coordination
      ui: User Interface - SDL2-based display, input, and debug visualization
      instructions: Instruction Set - Complete Game Boy instruction decode and execution
      registers: CPU Registers - Accumulator, flags, and general-purpose register management
      stack: Stack Operations - Call stack and interrupt stack management
      io: I/O Registers - Memory-mapped hardware register access
      debug: Debug Interface - Development tools and state inspection
      cpu_ops: CPU Operations - Instruction implementation functions
      cpu_util: CPU Utilities - Helper functions for instruction execution
      debug_timer: Timer Debugging - Specialized debugging for timer-related issues
      ppu_pipeline: PPU Pipeline - Graphics rendering pipeline stages

    System Integration:
      - All components communicate through the bus module
      - Timing is synchronized through the emu module's cycle counting
      - Interrupts coordinate between components via the interrupt controller
      - Debug information flows through specialized debug modules
      - UI provides real-time visualization of system state

    Accuracy Focus:
      - Cycle-accurate timing for critical components (CPU, PPU, Timer)
      - Accurate memory banking behavior for cartridge compatibility
      - Proper interrupt timing and priority handling
      - Audio synthesis matching original Game Boy characteristics
      - LCD timing modes and display behavior emulation
