/**
 * Timer Module - Game Boy Hardware Timer System
 * 
 * This module implements the Game Boy's timing system, which consists of a 16-bit internal
 * counter (DIV) and a configurable timer (TIMA/TMA/TAC). The timer system is crucial for
 * game timing, sound generation, and various game mechanics that depend on precise timing.
 * 
 * Hardware Components:
 * - DIV: 16-bit internal divider register (upper 8 bits readable at 0xFF04)
 * - TIMA: 8-bit timer counter that increments based on TAC frequency setting
 * - TMA: 8-bit timer modulo - value loaded into TIMA when it overflows
 * - TAC: 8-bit timer control register (enable bit + 2-bit frequency select)
 * 
 * Timer Frequencies (based on DIV bit transitions):
 * - 00: 4096 Hz (bit 9 of internal counter)
 * - 01: 262144 Hz (bit 3 of internal counter) 
 * - 10: 65536 Hz (bit 5 of internal counter)
 * - 11: 16384 Hz (bit 7 of internal counter)
 * 
 * The timer system generates interrupts when TIMA overflows from 0xFF to 0x00,
 * at which point TIMA is reloaded with the TMA value and a timer interrupt is requested.
 * 
 * Timing Accuracy:
 * The implementation uses edge detection on specific bits of the internal counter
 * to achieve cycle-accurate timer behavior that matches original Game Boy hardware.
